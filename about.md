My name is Anthony and I am a certified data/intelligence analyst and seasoned ethical hacker. Though my skillset is broad, my strongest talents are in Social Engineering, Penetrative Testing, and Data Analysis.
Ive earned a variety of professional level certifications while applying my craft. These include; 

|CompTIA's Project+ (pk001)|
|CompTIA's Data+ ce (da001)|
|Google Cybersecurity Professional|
|Google AI Essentials|
|Scrum Master Certified|

The majority of my skill set is a product of my passion for tech and creative thinking.
I originally began university for health and human services to become a social worker.
However, after losing my mother I dropped out and did not pursue that career field again.

I spend a lot of time prototyping with arduino, raspberry pi and adafruit. I also spend a 
considerable amount of time researching and practicing my craft. I compete in ctf's when
I am able and thoroughly enjoy open source intelligence gathering for case studies
and other random data science related areas of study.
