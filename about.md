I am a certified data analyst and a seasoned ethical hacker. Ive earned a variety
of professional level certifications while applying my craft. These include; 

-CompTIA's Project+ (pk001)
-CompTIA's Data+ ce (da001)
-Google Cybersecurity Professional
-Google AI Essentials
-Scrum Master Certified 
and more ...

The majority of my skill set is a product of my passion for tech and creative thinking.
I originally began university for health and human services to become a social worker.
However, after losing my mother I dropped out and did not pursue that career field again.

I spend a lot of time prototyping with arduino, raspberry pi and adafruit. I also spend a 
considerable amount of time researching and practicing my craft. I compete in ctf's when
I am able and thoroughly enjoy open source intelligence gathering for case studies
and other random data science related areas of study.
