## Its friday the 13th 
<hr noshade>
<tt>who gives a fluff? Ive never been the superstitious type. However I did decide not to test my luck though.</tt>
<tt>Spent most of the day sesigning and editing my professional site. Not much new to report.</tt>

## Changes to site:
<hr noshade>
<tt>The layout I envision has a spot for my work as an analyst as well as a section for any tools, or material that came from my analyst training that i can share.</tt>
<tt>I added a section called 'Analysts Comments' ... that gave me an idea for a blog of its own.</tt> 
<tt>analysts comment would be a daily/bidaily report for certain cyber security related events</tt>
## <tt><b>  ie; <b></tt>

### analysts comment
- []syria has fallen according to...
- []3 underwater sea cables have been severed causing data disruptions
- []several more aerial phenomenon have been sighted over the last week in northern new jersey
- []we're still in the fight
