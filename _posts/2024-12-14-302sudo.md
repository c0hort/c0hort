### Personal Note

<tt>Remember the date for posteritys sake. Today will be the first time Ive seen <b>'DJ' in probably 15 years.</b> My plan/hope was to see her before I left for DC. Ill be lodging with her for the evening and its a much needed respite.. for both of us it seems. Things have been refreshing, pleaseant, suprising, enticing, among many other things. Slow and Steady kid. Mars was always just another planet. You just didnt realize it until you finally took your eye out of the telescope. Things live, Things die. Things are reborn as we give ourselves the right to fly. So when youre torn and worn, look to the sky. Dawn from Dusk, born from lust, dark things can turn bright.</tt><br>
